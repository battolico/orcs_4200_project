\section{Conclusion}

In summary, this work illustrates the application of the LinUCB algorithm to the KuaiRec dataset for personalized, contextualized recommendations. The dense and feature-rich KuaiRec dataset enabled a thorough exploration of the algorithmâ€™s behavior, including its ability to learn contextual cues, balance exploration and exploitation, and achieve low regret. While the approach has demonstrated potential in improving sequential decision-making in recommendation scenarios, further studies may enhance its adaptability, robustness, and long-term utility in dynamic, real-world environments.
