\section{Conclusion}

In summary, this work illustrates the application of the LinUCB algorithm to the KuaiRec dataset for personalized, contextualized recommendations. The dense and feature-rich KuaiRec dataset enabled a thorough exploration of the algorithmâ€™s behavior, including its ability to learn contextual cues, balance exploration and exploitation, and achieve low regret. 

Unfortunately, while the approach has demonstrated potential in improving sequential decision-making in recommendation scenarios, the model presents heavy biases which may limit its usefulness or practicality for real-world applications. Further studies should seek to correct the dataset biases using bias mitigation techniques such as bias correction, bias amplification, and biased data sampling. Future works may also improve the model's adaptability, robustness, and long-term utility in dynamic, real-world environments.
